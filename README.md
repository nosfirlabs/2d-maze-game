# 2d-maze-game
A console based 2d maze game

This program generates a random maze with dimensions specified by the MAZE_WIDTH and MAZE_HEIGHT constants, and allows the player to navigate through the maze by entering a direction (North, South, East, or West) at the prompt. The maze is drawn to the console using ASCII characters, and the player's current position is indicated by a X. If the player reaches the top or bottom of the maze, they win the game.
